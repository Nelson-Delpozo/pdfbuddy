## Testing Status
- Unit tests: Started (security utilities)
- Integration tests: Started (watermark functionality)
- End-to-end tests: Framework in place
- Manual testing: Guide created, initial testing completed
- Performance testing: Not started
- Security testing: Started (security utilities)

## Known Issues
- Icons are currently placeholders and need to be replaced with real icons
- Security utilities need to be integrated with all features
- Watermark positioning controls need refinement
- User feedback during PDF generation needs improvement
- jsPDF integration needs more testing with different types of web pages
- Image watermarks need to be fully implemented and tested

## Blockers
