## Testing Status
- Unit tests: Not started
- Integration tests: Not started
- End-to-end tests: Not started
- Performance testing: Not started
- Security testing: Not started

## Known Issues
- Icons are currently placeholders and need to be replaced with real icons
- PDF generation is implemented but needs testing in a real browser environment
- Watermark functionality is implemented but needs testing with real PDFs
- Security utilities need to be integrated with all features

## Blockers
- No blockers identified

## Next Milestone
**End of Day 1**: Basic extension structure and PDF generation working

### Acceptance Criteria
- Extension loads in Chrome
- Browser action icon displays popup
- Context menu integration works
- Basic PDF generation functions
- Error handling for common scenarios
- Simple user feedback mechanism

## Notes and Observations
- Project is in initial setup phase
