## Recent Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Modular Design**: Implementing a modular architecture to facilitate future expansion and premium features
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Focusing on vanilla JavaScript and Chrome APIs to keep the extension lightweight
- **Storage Strategy**: Using chrome.storage.sync for settings and chrome.storage.local for templates
- **Error Handling**: Implementing a comprehensive error handling system from the start
- **Domain Acquisition**: Secured pdfbuddy.app domain and support@pdfbuddy.app email for future infrastructure

### Legal Decisions
- **Custom Proprietary License**: Created a custom license that restricts distribution to Chrome Web Store only
- **No Contributions Policy**: Established a policy against accepting external code contributions
- **Premium Features Protection**: Added license terms to protect premium features from unauthorized access
- **Intellectual Property Protection**: Implemented strong IP protections in the license


### UI Decisions
- **Clean Interface**: Prioritizing a minimal, intuitive UI
- **Dual Trigger**: Implementing both browser action and context menu triggers
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple interface for basic features, with advanced options in a separate panel

### Feature Decisions
- **Watermark Implementation**: Using Canvas API for watermark rendering
- **PDF Generation**: Leveraging Chrome's built-in printing capabilities
- **Template System**: Creating a flexible template system for watermark configurations

## Active Considerations

### Technical Challenges
- How to efficiently apply watermarks to PDFs
- Handling large or complex web pages
- Managing memory usage during PDF generation
- Ensuring consistent rendering across different types of content

### User Experience Questions
- Finding the right balance between simplicity and functionality
- Ensuring intuitive watermark positioning controls
- Creating clear differentiation between free and premium features
- Providing helpful feedback during PDF generation process

### Implementation Priorities
- Establishing a solid foundation before adding advanced features
- Ensuring core functionality works reliably before adding premium features
- Creating extensible components that can be enhanced later
- Building with testing and maintenance in mind

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. ‚úÖ Create the basic extension structure
2. ‚úÖ Implement the manifest.json file
3. ‚úÖ Set up the background script
4. ‚úÖ Create the popup UI
5. ‚úÖ Implement context menu integration
6. ‚úÖ Create the basic PDF generation functionality
7. ‚úÖ Implement security infrastructure
8. ‚è≥ Test the extension in Chrome
9. ‚è≥ Fix any initial bugs
10. ‚è≥ Refine the watermark implementation

### Upcoming Milestones
- **End of Day 1**: Basic extension structure and PDF generation working
- **End of Day 2**: Text watermarking and basic UI components
- **End of Day 3**: Image watermarks and template system
- **End of Day 4**: Premium infrastructure and integration
- **End of Day 5**: Testing, documentation, and store preparation
