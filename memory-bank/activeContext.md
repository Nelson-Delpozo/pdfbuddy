# PDF Buddy - Active Context

## Current Development Phase
**Day 1: Foundation Phase**

We are currently in the initial setup and foundation phase of the PDF Buddy Chrome extension. This phase focuses on establishing the core architecture, project structure, and basic functionality that will serve as the foundation for all future development.

## Current Focus Areas

### Project Setup
- ✅ Creating the basic extension structure
- ✅ Setting up the development environment
- ✅ Establishing the Memory Bank documentation
- ✅ Configuring initial manifest.json

### Core Architecture
- ✅ Implementing the background script infrastructure
- ✅ Setting up communication channels between components
- ✅ Creating the basic storage utilities
- ✅ Establishing error handling patterns

### Security Infrastructure
- ✅ Implementing security utilities for input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Creating Content Security Policy configuration
- ✅ Defining security constants and patterns
- ✅ Implementing permission management utilities
- ✅ Updating manifest.json with security configurations

### Basic PDF Generation
- ✅ Implementing the core PDF generation functionality
- ✅ Setting up the content script for page capture
- ✅ Creating the basic UI components
- ✅ Establishing the download mechanism

### Testing and Refinement
- ⏳ Testing the extension in Chrome
- ⏳ Fixing any initial bugs
- ⏳ Refining the user interface

## Recent Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Modular Design**: Implementing a modular architecture to facilitate future expansion and premium features
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Focusing on vanilla JavaScript and Chrome APIs to keep the extension lightweight
- **Storage Strategy**: Using chrome.storage.sync for settings and chrome.storage.local for templates
- **Error Handling**: Implementing a comprehensive error handling system from the start

### UI Decisions
- **Clean Interface**: Prioritizing a minimal, intuitive UI
- **Dual Trigger**: Implementing both browser action and context menu triggers
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple interface for basic features, with advanced options in a separate panel

### Feature Decisions
- **Watermark Implementation**: Using Canvas API for watermark rendering
- **PDF Generation**: Leveraging Chrome's built-in printing capabilities
- **Template System**: Creating a flexible template system for watermark configurations

## Active Considerations

### Technical Challenges
- How to efficiently apply watermarks to PDFs
- Handling large or complex web pages
- Managing memory usage during PDF generation
- Ensuring consistent rendering across different types of content

### User Experience Questions
- Finding the right balance between simplicity and functionality
- Ensuring intuitive watermark positioning controls
- Creating clear differentiation between free and premium features
- Providing helpful feedback during PDF generation process

### Implementation Priorities
- Establishing a solid foundation before adding advanced features
- Ensuring core functionality works reliably before adding premium features
- Creating extensible components that can be enhanced later
- Building with testing and maintenance in mind

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. ✅ Create the basic extension structure
2. ✅ Implement the manifest.json file
3. ✅ Set up the background script
4. ✅ Create the popup UI
5. ✅ Implement context menu integration
6. ✅ Create the basic PDF generation functionality
7. ✅ Implement security infrastructure
8. ⏳ Test the extension in Chrome
9. ⏳ Fix any initial bugs
10. ⏳ Refine the watermark implementation

### Upcoming Milestones
- **End of Day 1**: Basic extension structure and PDF generation working
- **End of Day 2**: Text watermarking and basic UI components
- **End of Day 3**: Image watermarks and template system
- **End of Day 4**: Premium infrastructure and integration
- **End of Day 5**: Testing, documentation, and store preparation
