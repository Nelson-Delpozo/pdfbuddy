## Recent Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Modular Design**: Implementing a modular architecture to facilitate future expansion and premium features
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Focusing on vanilla JavaScript and Chrome APIs to keep the extension lightweight
- **Storage Strategy**: Using chrome.storage.sync for settings and chrome.storage.local for templates
- **Error Handling**: Implementing a comprehensive error handling system from the start
- **Domain Acquisition**: Secured pdfbuddy.app domain and support@pdfbuddy.app email for future infrastructure

### Legal Decisions
- **Custom Proprietary License**: Created a custom license that restricts distribution to Chrome Web Store only
- **No Contributions Policy**: Established a policy against accepting external code contributions
- **Premium Features Protection**: Added license terms to protect premium features from unauthorized access
- **Intellectual Property Protection**: Implemented strong IP protections in the license


### UI Decisions
- **Clean Interface**: Prioritizing a minimal, intuitive UI
- **Dual Trigger**: Implementing both browser action and context menu triggers
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple interface for basic features, with advanced options in a separate panel

### Feature Decisions
- **Watermark Implementation**: Using Canvas API for watermark rendering
- **PDF Generation**: Leveraging Chrome's built-in printing capabilities
- **Template System**: Creating a flexible template system for watermark configurations

## Active Considerations

### Technical Challenges
- How to efficiently apply watermarks to PDFs
- Handling large or complex web pages
- Managing memory usage during PDF generation
- Ensuring consistent rendering across different types of content

### User Experience Questions
- Finding the right balance between simplicity and functionality
- Ensuring intuitive watermark positioning controls
- Creating clear differentiation between free and premium features
- Providing helpful feedback during PDF generation process

### Implementation Priorities
- Establishing a solid foundation before adding advanced features
- Ensuring core functionality works reliably before adding premium features
- Creating extensible components that can be enhanced later
- Building with testing and maintenance in mind

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. ✅ Create the basic extension structure
2. ✅ Implement the manifest.json file
3. ✅ Set up the background script
4. ✅ Create the popup UI
5. ✅ Implement context menu integration
6. ✅ Create the basic PDF generation functionality
7. ✅ Implement security infrastructure
8. ⏳ Test the extension in Chrome
9. ⏳ Fix any initial bugs
10. ⏳ Refine the watermark implementation

### Upcoming Milestones
- **End of Day 1**: Basic extension structure and PDF generation working
- **End of Day 2**: Text watermarking and basic UI components
- **End of Day 3**: Image watermarks and template system
- **End of Day 4**: Premium infrastructure and integration
- **End of Day 5**: Testing, documentation, and store preparation
