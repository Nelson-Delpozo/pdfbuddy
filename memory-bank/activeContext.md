## Recent Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Modular Design**: Implementing a modular architecture to facilitate future expansion and premium features
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Focusing on vanilla JavaScript and Chrome APIs to keep the extension lightweight
- **Storage Strategy**: Using chrome.storage.sync for settings and chrome.storage.local for templates
- **Error Handling**: Implementing a comprehensive error handling system from the start
- **Domain Acquisition**: Secured pdfbuddy.app domain and support@pdfbuddy.app email for future infrastructure
- **ES Modules**: Using ES modules for better code organization and maintainability
- **Service Worker**: Implementing proper error handling for service worker environments
- **Build System**: Added webpack for bundling to resolve CSP and module loading issues
- **DOM API Handling**: Moving DOM-dependent operations to content scripts to work around service worker limitations

### Technical Fixes
- **Module Loading**: Fixed issues with ES module loading in Chrome extension context
- **Service Worker Compatibility**: Enhanced error handling and security utilities to work in service worker context
- **Window Object Handling**: Improved code to handle environments where window is not available
- **PDF Generation**: Fixed PDF generation by using the correct Chrome API (chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab)
- **Blob Handling**: Updated code to properly handle Blob data for PDF generation and watermarking
- **Permissions**: Added tabs permission required for PDF generation
- **CSP Issues**: Fixed Content Security Policy issues by bundling jsPDF with webpack
- **Manifest Loading**: Fixed manifest loading error by removing unsafe-eval from CSP
- **DOM API in Service Worker**: Fixed "Image is not defined" error by moving image processing to content script
- **Full-Page PDF Capture**: Implemented scrolling screenshot approach for capturing the entire page, not just the visible portion
- **PDF Generation Error**: Fixed "Failed to generate PDF" error by:
  - Adding null check for logCallback function in error-handler.js
  - Fixing PDF merging logic in pdf-generator.js
  - Updating content.js to properly handle processImage action
  - Fixing captureFullPage option to default to false (current screen only)
  - Adding explicit "Capture Full Page" checkbox to popup.html for better user control
  - Implementing full page capture functionality in content.js using canvas to capture the entire page

### Legal Decisions
- **Custom Proprietary License**: Created a custom license that restricts distribution to Chrome Web Store only
- **No Contributions Policy**: Established a policy against accepting external code contributions
- **Premium Features Protection**: Added license terms to protect premium features from unauthorized access
- **Intellectual Property Protection**: Implemented strong IP protections in the license

### UI Decisions
- **Clean Interface**: Prioritizing a minimal, intuitive UI
- **Dual Trigger**: Implementing both browser action and context menu triggers
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple interface for basic features, with advanced options in a separate panel

### Feature Decisions
- **Watermark Implementation**: Using Canvas API for watermark rendering
- **PDF Generation**: Using jsPDF for PDF generation from captured screenshots
- **Template System**: Creating a flexible template system for watermark configurations

## Active Considerations

### Technical Challenges
- How to efficiently apply watermarks to PDFs
- Handling large or complex web pages
- Managing memory usage during PDF generation
- Ensuring consistent rendering across different types of content

### User Experience Questions
- Finding the right balance between simplicity and functionality
- Ensuring intuitive watermark positioning controls
- Creating clear differentiation between free and premium features
- Providing helpful feedback during PDF generation process

### Implementation Priorities
- Establishing a solid foundation before adding advanced features
- Ensuring core functionality works reliably before adding premium features
- Creating extensible components that can be enhanced later
- Building with testing and maintenance in mind
