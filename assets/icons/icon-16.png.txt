This is a placeholder for the 16x16 icon.

In a real implementation, this would be a 16x16 PNG file with the extension icon.

For Chrome extensions, you need icons in multiple sizes:
- 16x16: Used in the Chrome extension management page
- 48x48: Used in the Chrome Web Store
- 128x128: Used in the Chrome Web Store and installation

Please replace this file with a real 16x16 PNG icon before publishing the extension.
