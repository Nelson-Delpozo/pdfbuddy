# PDF Buddy - Project Intelligence

## Project Patterns

### Code Style
- Use ES6+ JavaScript throughout the project
- Prefer const over let, and avoid var
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes and constructors
- Use arrow functions for callbacks and anonymous functions
- Add JSDoc comments for all public functions and methods
- Maintain 2-space indentation for all files
- Use single quotes for strings unless the string contains single quotes
- Always use semicolons at the end of statements

### Architecture Patterns
- Follow module pattern for encapsulation
- Use event-driven communication between components
- Implement factory pattern for creating different types of watermarks
- Use strategy pattern for different PDF generation approaches
- Maintain clear separation between UI and business logic
- Implement observer pattern for state changes

### File Organization
- Group files by feature rather than by type
- Keep related files close together
- Use index.js files to expose public API of modules
- Maintain consistent naming conventions across files
- Organize CSS with component-specific files

### Chrome Extension Patterns
- Follow Manifest V3 requirements
- Use service workers for background scripts
- Implement content scripts only when necessary
- Use chrome.storage.sync for user preferences
- Use chrome.storage.local for larger data
- Implement proper error handling for all Chrome API calls

## Development Workflow

### Implementation Sequence
1. Start with core infrastructure and utilities
2. Implement basic functionality without premium features
3. Add UI components and user interaction
4. Implement watermarking capabilities
5. Add template system and storage
6. Implement premium feature infrastructure
7. Add analytics and error tracking
8. Polish and optimize

### Testing Approach
- Write unit tests for core utilities and business logic
- Implement integration tests for feature workflows
- Test in Chrome browser regularly
- Verify functionality across different types of web pages
- Test with various watermark configurations
- Validate storage and retrieval of settings

### Deployment Process
- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Test thoroughly before each release
- Update documentation with each release
- Maintain a detailed changelog
- Follow Chrome Web Store submission guidelines

## User Preferences

### UI Preferences
- Clean, minimal interface
- Intuitive controls with clear labels
- Visual feedback for actions
- Consistent styling throughout
- Progressive disclosure of advanced features
- Clear differentiation between free and premium features

### Feature Priorities
- Fast, reliable PDF generation
- Simple watermark application
- Easy template management
- Intuitive positioning controls
- Clear feedback during operations
- Reliable error handling

## Technical Decisions

### PDF Generation
- Use Chrome's built-in printing capabilities via chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab and chrome.printing API
- Apply watermarks using Canvas API
- Generate PDFs in memory before saving to disk
- Optimize for performance with large pages

### Watermarking
- Render watermarks on canvas
- Support text with various styling options
- Support images with transparency
- Implement positioning using relative coordinates
- Support rotation and scaling
- Implement opacity controls

### Storage
- Use chrome.storage.sync for settings and preferences
- Use chrome.storage.local for templates and larger data
- Implement proper error handling for storage operations
- Optimize storage usage to stay within Chrome limits

### Error Handling
- Implement comprehensive error tracking
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Log detailed error information for debugging
- Implement recovery mechanisms where possible
- Track errors in analytics for prioritization

## Known Challenges

### Technical Limitations
- Chrome's PDF generation capabilities may have limitations
- Storage limits for chrome.storage APIs
- Performance considerations for large pages
- Cross-origin restrictions for content scripts
- Manifest V3 restrictions on background scripts

### User Experience Challenges
- Balancing simplicity with functionality
- Creating intuitive watermark positioning controls
- Clearly communicating premium features without being intrusive
- Providing helpful feedback during PDF generation
- Handling errors gracefully

## Evolution Tracking

### Version 1.0 Goals
- Basic PDF generation
- Simple text watermarking
- Basic template system
- Context menu and browser action
- Essential settings storage
- Error handling foundation

### Future Enhancements
- Advanced watermark editing
- Batch processing
- Cloud storage integration
- Additional customization options
- Enhanced template management
- Integration with other services
